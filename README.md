# Nester Dynamic Type Inference Tool Guide

This guide explains how to run the Nester dynamic type inference tool using the `torchrun` command. In this example, we use a pre-trained checkpoint and configure the model's maximum sequence length and batch size.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.9
- Linux operating system

## Install

Clone this repository and run the following command in the root directory to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Download the dataset [here](#) (click the link to download the dataset).
2. Set up [Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) and [CodeLlama](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-codellama/) locally.
3. Run Nester on CodeLlama with the dataset using the following command:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 nester.py     --ckpt_dir=CodeLlama-7b-Instruct/     --tokenizer_path=CodeLlama-7b-Instruct/tokenizer.model     --max_seq_len=2048     --max_batch_size=4
```

### Evaluate

To evaluate the Nester results, use the following command to calculate the Exact Match metric:

```bash
python nester/nester.py -s predictions.json -t testset.json -m -c
```

For match to parametric evaluation, simply add the `-i` option:

```bash
python nester/nester.py -s predictions.json -t testset.json -m -c -i
```

### Parameter Explanation

- `--nproc_per_node`: Specifies the number of processes per node. In this example, it is set to 1.
- `--ckpt_dir`: Specifies the directory path for the model checkpoint, ensuring pre-trained weights are loaded.
- `--tokenizer_path`: Specifies the path for the tokenizer used by the tool.
- `--max_seq_len`: Sets the maximum sequence length for the model. It is recommended to set this value to 2048 to ensure performance during inference.
- `--max_batch_size`: Specifies the maximum batch size. Adjust this value based on hardware resources and performance requirements to optimize computational efficiency.

### Environment Requirements

- PyTorch
- Hardware resources should be sufficient to support large-scale model computations. It is recommended to use a GPU to improve processing speed.
